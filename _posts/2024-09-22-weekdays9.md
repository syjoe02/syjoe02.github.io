# React

### Github : [KRX-frontend](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx-frontend)

### 1. **Asynchronous**

- `authTokenLogin.js`

   ```js
      const handleLogin = async () => {
   ```

   Define ansynchronous
   
   1. It is triggered when the user click the login button

   2. And it involves a request to the server

### 2. **localStorage** 

- User can checks own Token through the developer tools in their browser's localstorage

   Can not access another user's token or data. But it is still risk of token theft

- `HttpOnly cookies`, It is more secure to protect
