# React

### Github : [KRX-frontend](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx-frontend)

### 1. **Asynchronous**

- `authTokenLogin.js`

   ```js
      const handleLogin = async () => {
   ```

   Define ansynchronous
   
   1. It is triggered when the user click the login button

   2. And it involves a request to the server

### 2. **localStorage** 

- User can checks own Token through the developer tools in their browser's localstorage

   Can not access another user's token or data. But it is still risk of token theft

- `HttpOnly cookies`, It is more secure to protect

### 3. **Login Problems**

1. The first login attempt fails, there could be an issue with the server response

- After the first failed login attempt, it is important to reset the error state before trying again.

   clear the error each time a new login attempt

   ```js
   useEffect(() => {
      const token = localStorage.getItem("authToken");
      if (token) {
         setIsAuthenticated(true);
      } else {
         setIsAuthenticated(false);
      }
   }, []); // Runs only once when the component mounts
   ```

2. Even though a use hasn't logged in, they are still able to access the `/search` page. This happens because the authentication check may not be function properly or it's being bypassed.

- After a successful login, the `isAuthenticated` state is properly set to true and then the authentication token is stored in `localStorage`
