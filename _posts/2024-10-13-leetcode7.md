# Climbing Stairs

### 1. Code

- Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;

        int prev1 = 2;
        int prev2 = 1;
        int current = 0;

        for (int i = 3;i < n+1; i++) {
            current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
};
```

### 1. **Fibonacci**

- The problem is similar to calculating the Fibonacci sequence becuase it has a structure where the current state is calcuated `based on the previous states`

- The reason why

    $$ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n+2)$$
    
    1. n-1 step, adding 1 step will take you to the n-th step

    2. n-2 step, adding 2 steps will take you to the n-th step

        So, n-th step is the sum of all the ways to reach `n-1 step + n-2 step`
