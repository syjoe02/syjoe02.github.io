# Coursera
- This is a API course is one part of the overall [Meta Back-end Developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer) course

### **Pipenv**

- For the first time, I'm using `pipenv` as I'm accustomed to using `virtualenv` and `pip`

    So, I was curious about the differences between them and the benefits of using `pipenv`

- `requirements.txt` and (`Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`) are all used to manage the dependencies of a Python project

### **Requirements.txt**

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    First, install the packages, and then compare the hash value specificed in requirements.txt with the actual hash value of the package

    If the hash does not match, the package installation is stopped and error message is displayed

    `SHA256` hash algorithm, generated when the package is installed
    
    **Key point** : Not abstract, specify the exact versions of dependencies

### **Pipfile**

- `Pipfile` & `Pipfile.lock`

    On the other hand, you can make abstract dependency declaration using `Pipfile`. you can delcare dependencies without <u>specifying a certain version</u>

    The `abstract dependency` refers to the way of requesting packages without specifying a specfic version. For example, when you need the **requests** package, but <u>you don't need to specify which version you need.</u>

    `Pipfile.lock` interprets these abstract dependencies into specific versions and includes the hash of each package

    Therefore, using `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` allows you to manage dependencies more conveniently and securely

- Team Project

    Usually, One person runs the `pipnev lock` command to create the `Pipfile.lock` and shares this file with all team members.

### **How to use pipfile**

1. Install pipenv
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    ```

2. Install package (for me, I installed django)
    ```bash
    pipenv install django
    ```
    This command creates `Pipfile` in your directory


Or, add package directly to the Pipfile

2. Create text file `Pipfile`
    ```text
    [[source]]
    url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
    verify_ssl = true
    name = "pypi"

    [packages]
    django = "*"
    djangorestframework = "*"
    djangorestframework-xml = "*"
    djoser = "*"

    [dev-packages]

    [requires]
    python_version = "3.11"
    ```
    In this case, I added django, DRF, djoser packages under the `[packages]` section.

3. Run Install 
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

- Once the installation is complete (create Pipfile or using `pipenv install`), Update the `Pipfile.lock`

    ```bash
    pipenv lock
    ```
