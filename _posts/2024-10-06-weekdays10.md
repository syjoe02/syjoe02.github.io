# Django

### Github : [KRX](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx)

### 1. **spaCy's lemmatization**

- Currently, the code that only checks for "exceeded" (base)

   So, I modify the function to detect not just "exceed" but also its various forms (exceeded, exceeding etc..)

- lemmatization : converts words into their base or dictionary form 

   ```python
   # Detect comparison type (handle multiple forms of exceed and less)
    for token in doc:
        if "exceed" in token.lemma_ or "greater" in token.text or "above" in token.text:
            comparison_type = "greater_than_equal"
        elif "less" in token.text or "below" in token.text:
            comparison_type = "less_than_equal"
   ```

# React

### Github : [KRX-frontend](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx-frontend)

### 1. **Ternary Operator**

- condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

   It is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement

   ```js
   <h3>Related Companies</h3>
   {companies.length > 0 ? (
      companies.map((company, index) => (
            <div
               key={index}
               onClick={() => setSelectedCompany(company)}
               style={{
                  cursor: 'pointer',
                  margin: '10px 0',
                  padding: '10px',
                  border: selectedCompany === company ? '2px solid red' : '1px solid #ccc',
                  borderRadius: '5px'
               }}
            >
               {index + 1}. {company.name} ({company.ticker})
            </div>
      ))
   ) : (
      <p>No companies found.</p>
   )}
   ```

### 2. **Basic of React***

- State Management (`useState`)

   It is a React hook that lets you add state to functional components

   ```js
   function StockQuery() {
      const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
      const [companies, setCompanies] = useState([]);
      const [selectedCompany, setSelectedCompany] = useState(null);
      const [price, setPrice] = useState(120);  // Default price
      const [comparisonType, setComparisonType] = useState("");
      const [step, setStep] = useState(1);  // Manages step 1, 2, and 3
      const [results, setResults] = useState([]);  // Holds the search results

      ...
   ```
   
   This code initializes `query` and updates it using `setQuery()`

- How it Works

   1. Initial State: `useState("")` initializes query as an empty string.

   2. State Updates: Each time `setQuery()` is called (e.g., when the user types), the state is updated.

   3. Component Re-renders: React automatically re-renders the component when the state changes.
