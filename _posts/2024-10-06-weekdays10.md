# Django

### Github : [KRX](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx)

### 1. **spaCy's lemmatization**

- Currently, the code that only checks for "exceeded" (base)

   So, I modify the function to detect not just "exceed" but also its various forms (exceeded, exceeding etc..)

- lemmatization : converts words into their base or dictionary form 

   ```python
   # Detect comparison type (handle multiple forms of exceed and less)
    for token in doc:
        if "exceed" in token.lemma_ or "greater" in token.text or "above" in token.text:
            comparison_type = "greater_than_equal"
        elif "less" in token.text or "below" in token.text:
            comparison_type = "less_than_equal"
   ```
