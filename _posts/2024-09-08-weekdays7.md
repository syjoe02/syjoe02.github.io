# Django

### Github : [KRX](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx)

### 1. **Natural Language (NLP)**
   - Using **spaCy**, I built a function to extract a stock name (company name) and a price threshold

   - For exmaple, If i ask "What did Apple stock price exceed 120 dollars?" 
   
      then the query was processed to find a company (Apple) and price (120)

### 2. **APIs**

- Using yfinance, fetch historical stock data

- I also used the Polygon API to fetch real-time stock **tickers** dynamically.

   Resolve the company name to the correct ticker
