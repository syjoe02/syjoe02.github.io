# Django

### Github : [KRX](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx)

### 1. **Natural Language (NLP)**
   - Using **spaCy**, I built a function to extract a stock name (company name) and a price threshold

   - For exmaple, If i ask "What did Apple stock price exceed 120 dollars?" 
   
      then the query was processed to find a company (Apple) and price (120)

### 2. **APIs**

- Using yfinance, fetch historical stock data

- I also used the Polygon API to fetch real-time stock **tickers** dynamically.

   Resolve the company name to the correct ticker


# React

### 1. **JWT Token Interceptors**

- Create a `axiosInstance.js` with an interceptor

   Automatically attached to the **Authorization header** for every request

### 2. **401 Unauthorization**

- Ensure that the token is correctly stored in `localStorage` after login

### 3. Difference Between `<div>` and `<route>`

### div

- Used for grouping content together for layout purpose

   ```html
   <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
   </div>
   ```
### route

- It is part of React Router

- It defines a path in the app and tells React Router which component to render when the URL matchs that path
