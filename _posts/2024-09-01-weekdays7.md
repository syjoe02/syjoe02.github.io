# Django

### Github : [Potato](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx)

### 1. Understand how the `src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` components is dsigned

   - The sign-in-form component handles its own state internally using `react-hook-form`, which means I donâ€™t need to pass down email, password, onEmailChange and OnPasswordChange as props from page.tsx

# Django Packages

### Github : [KRX](https://github.com/syjoe02/Krx)

### 1. **Custom Authentication with Email or Username**
   - A custom login function was implemented to allow users to log in using either a **username or email** along with a **password**

   - `authenticate()` function defaults to **username**, so to enable email authentication, an **EmailBackend** was implemented. (stockapp/backends.py)

        The **settings.py** file was updated to include `EmailBackend` in `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`.

   - In the `CustomTokenCreateSerializer`, the code distinguishes between email and username using `'@'` in the string

### 2. **Django REST Framework Setup for Token Authentication**
   - The login endpoint `/auth/token/login/` was configured to return a token upon valid credentials

   - To ensure that the login endpoint works without prior authentication, the `permission_classes` for the view were set to `AllowAny`
    
        ```python
        from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny
        class CustomTokenCreateView(APIView):
            permission_classes = [AllowAny] 
            ...
        ```

   - Token authentication was set as the default authentication method in **settings.py**

### 3. **Testing and Debugging**
   - `curl` was used to test the login API, sending **POST** requests with either a username or email and password

   - The error message `"Authentication credentials were not provided"` was resolved by ensuring that the login endpoint does not require authentication
