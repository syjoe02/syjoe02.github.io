###  **Data Structure**

- Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and functions that can be applied to the data

- staying inside the main memory during the execution

### **Database**

- Collection of structure data used for storing, retrieving, adding, modifying, and deleting information

- Stored on a HDD (Hard Disk Drive Storage), and the data is typically arranged in tables

- RDBMS, Relational Database Management Systems are the most commonly used software to manage databases

### **Data Warehouse**

- A large collection of data that is currently ```inactive```. 

- Collects data from various sources within an organization and uses that data to provide bussiness insights through analysis

- Typically, It preserve data over a long period of time, useful for historial analysis

### **Big data**

- Large amounts of data accumulating daily on the internet


# Physical VS Logical Data Structure

### 1. **Physical Data Structure**

- Manage how the data will be stored in the memory of a comptuer. 

- Directly deals with the memory storage operations 

- Array / Linked List

### 2. **Logical Data Structure**

- high-level, abstract data sturcture that help to organize and manipulate the data in a more efficient

- Not deal with the memory organization, But focus on ```the logical view or task```

- Stack / Queue / Trees / Graph / Hash Table

### **ADT (Abstract Data Type)**

- Encapsulate the data and operations it can be performed on the data.

- It does not reveal the internal working of the data structure, hence the term ```abstract```

### **Why?**

- It allows us to focus on what the data structure does

- It makes it easier to manage complex systems by separating the interface (what the system does) from the implementation (how the system does it).

- Example code

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    # Operation: push
    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)

    # Operation: pop
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack) < 1:
            return None
        return self.stack.pop()

    # Operation: peek (view the top item)
    def peek(self): 
        if not self.stack:
            return None
        return self.stack[-1]

    # Operation: is_empty (check if the stack is empty)
    def is_empty(self):
        return not bool(self.stack)

    # Operation: size (get the size of the stack)
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```

- Data : ```self.stack``` and Operations : ```push, pop, peek, is_empty, size```

# Time & Space Complexity

### 1. **Example Code**

```c++
void swap(x,y)
{
	int temp;

	temp = x; // -> 1 (assignment)
	x = y;    // -> 1 (assignment)
	y = temp; // -> 1 (assignment)
}
```

Calculate the time complexity:

- f(n) = 3n^0  = O(n^0) = O(1)

```c++
int sum(int A[], int n)
{
	int s,i; 
	s = 0;              // -> 1 (assignment)

	for (i=0; i<n; i++) // -> n+1
	{
		s = s+A[i];     // -> n
	}
	return s;           // -> 1 (assignment)
}
```
Calculate the time complexity:

- f(n) = 2n + 3 = O(n)

### **Explanation**

In this for loop
```c++
for (i=0; i<n; i++)
```
- ```i = 0```

	It is assignment. `1`
- ```i<n```

	condition, So It is `n` but, we have to add `+1` for the condtiion fail
	So, It is `n+1`

- ```i++```

	It is `n`

- We can ignore all others (1 and n), so for loop takes `n+1`

### 2. **Example Code**

```c++
void Add(int n)
{
	int i,j;

	for (i=0;i<n;i++) 					 //-> n+1
	{
		for (j=0;j<n;j++) 				 //-> n*(n+1)
		{
			c[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]; //-> n*n
		}
	}
}
```

Calculate the time complexity:

- f(n) = 2n^2 + 2n + 1 = O(n^2)

### **Explanation**

- `n+1`

	outer for loop (same principle above the only one for loop fucntion)

- `n*(n+1)`

	Outer loop iterates `n` times * Also, inner loop condition iterates `n+1`

- `n*n`

	Executed for each iteration of both outer and inner `n*n`
