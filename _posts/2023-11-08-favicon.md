`Favicon` is a small icon that represents a website. It displayed in places like the web browser's address bar.

The [favicons](https://www.favicon-generator.org/about/) of [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) are placed in the directory `assets/img/favicons/`

### Prepare the Square icon

I got a free icon in this website, [**icons8**](https://icons8.com/icons)

- When the padding size is too small, I cannot identify what is the icon. So I have set the size like this.

    ![padding-size](/assets/img/blog/padding-size.png)


- Prepare a square image (PNG, JPG, or SVG) with a size of `512x512` or more

    ![png-size](/assets/img/blog/png-size.png)


### Generate the favicon

And then, go to the online tool [**Real Favicon Generator**](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and click the button <kbd>Select your Favicon image</kbd> to upload your image file

- Settings

    It sets how the icons will appear in each browser

    and click the button <kbd>Generate your Favicons and HTML code</kbd> to install your package

- Package

    Download your package

    ![favicon-package](/assets/img/blog/favicon-package.png)

### Apply the Code

- Copy and Paste the directory and change the directory name `favicons`

- Edit the code

    - `browserconfig.xml`

        ```xml
        ---
        layout: compress
        ---

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <browserconfig>
            <msapplication>
                <tile>
                    <square150x150logo src="{{ '/assets/img/favicons/mstile-150x150.png' | relative_url }}"/>
                    <TileColor>#da532c</TileColor>
                </tile>
            </msapplication>
        </browserconfig>
        ```

    - `site.webmanifest`

        When using Liquid tag in a Markdown flie, Liquid tag (`assign favicon_path ...`) is interpreted and processed during the server's page-building process<br><br>
        So, I took a capture instead of writing a code
